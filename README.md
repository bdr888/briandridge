### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I'm Brian. I'm a software engineer experienced in building accessible and performant web applications, mostly using React and GraphQL.

âš¡ I'm passionate about DX and team process, and love to use modern DevOps practices and create automated CI/CD pipelines.

ğŸ”­ Lately I've been interested in Infrastructure as Code, and currently learning to use Terraform with AWS and Azure.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m also taking the plunge and learning Typescript
